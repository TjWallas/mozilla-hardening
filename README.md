# Firefox Hardening

This Repo contains a list of about:config settings that I have changed for both
preferential reasons, and also privacy and security reasons.

See the user.js file for my about:config settings.

## Usage

Please visit [User.js File](http://kb.mozillazine.org/User.js_file) for details
on how to apply the user.js file to your install of Firefox.

In short, you can either go to the url `about:config` and search for the configs
manually and set them, or you can move the user.js file to the
[profile folder](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder) which differs across
operating systems.

In thunderbird, you can get to the `about:config` by going to
`Edit -> Preferences`, then select the `Advanced` panel, and then select the
`General` tab. Now click `Config Editor`.

## Thanks

Thanks to
[Haasn](https://github.com/haasn)
for their about:config
[gist](https://gist.github.com/haasn/69e19fc2fe0e25f3cff5)
in which I found many of my current settings.

Also thanks to [CHEF-KOCH](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH)
/
[NoScript-Whitelist](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/NoScript-Whitelist)
For their uBlock, and NoScript settings, which are a huge help. I will not be
posting my configurations here as the license requires a list of changes.
Regardless, most of the settings are from that repo.
